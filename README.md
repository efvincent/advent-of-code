# Advent of Code 2020!
This (messy) repo includes both some 2019 I was practicing on earlier as well as 2020 - reflected in year sub-folders.
## Running Score
Well one thing's clear... I'm not going to break any speed records. I'm happy to take this
as a fun exercise and a good excuse to play with Haskell and hopefully learn some useful stuff
over the next 23 days! ðŸ˜ƒ

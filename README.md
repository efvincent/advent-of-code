# Advent of Code 2020!
This (messy) repo includes both some 2019 I was practicing on earlier as well as 2020 - reflected in year sub-folders.
## Running Score
Well one thing's clear... I'm not going to break any speed records. I'm happy to take this as a fun exercise and a good excuse to play with Haskell and hopefully learn some useful stuff over the next 19 days! ðŸ˜ƒ

### Day 6 complete
Fastest time so far for part 1 - good for my standards ðŸ™‚

Days 6 and 5 were both easier than the days that preceded them. Not complaining b/c I'm sure there'll be some whoppers coming before long.

#### Benchmarks!
Came across a few new things last couple of days, most interesting is the [Criterion](http://www.serpentine.com/criterion/) library for Benchmarking in Haskell. It'll be interesting when I have an algorithm that is in obvious need of improvement. For now here's [the result from Day 6](benchmarks/20/aoc-bench-day06.html).
